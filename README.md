# Direction-of-Arrival-Estimation-for-RADAR
Direction of arrivals (DoA) classic and super-resolution algorithms such Multi-signals Classification (MUSIC) and estimation of signal parameters via rotational invariant techniques (ESPRIT) and their application in MIMO RADAR to localize targets in the field of view of RADAR. 
You will find in this repsitory :
- A python script demonstrating the importance of using more Uniform Linear Antenna, change the number of ULA and run the script to see every algorithm performance. 
- Angle estimation based on MUSIC, root MUSIC and ESPRIT algorithms in MIMO RADAR (MATLAB)
- Modified super-resolution DoA estimation algorithm (MATLAB)
